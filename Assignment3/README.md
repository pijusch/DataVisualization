Design Excercise

<ol>

<li> Domain task is to analyze the encounter events of patients. We want to look at the pre-TBI and post-TBI data for each patient and try to find some interesting trends between TBI and other medical conditions.
</li>

<li> We plot the information of all patients (encounter type, disease timeline, age etc) on a 2D plot. The x-axis represents the temporal information and y axis represents different patients (without ordering).
</li>

<li> The figures in this folder give the design that we came up with. Please find the detailed review of the design in DesignDiscussion.pdf file.
